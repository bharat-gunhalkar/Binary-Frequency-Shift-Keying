# Binary-Frequency-Shift-Keying

A sampled sine signal is quantized and then encoded. This encoded signal is sent to the FSK modulator. Then the signal is passed through a Gaussian Noise channel. The received signal is then passed through an FSK demodulator to get back the signal. The signal is then sent to the quantizer decoder to get the signal. The “Error Rate Calculation” block is employed to get the BER.
